                                    <li> Design a parametric, press-fit object in Fusion 360 and use the laser cutter and 4mm plywood to build the object.</li>

                                <h2 class = "major"> Vinyl cutter</h2>
                                <p>I used <a href ="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a> to draw and then the vinyl cutter to make a yellow sticker of my inital letter "J". </p>
                                <img src="images/J.jpg" width ="400px" height = "auto" />
                                
                                <h2 class = "major"> Kerf measurement test with Katla</h2>
                                <p>When using a laser cutter it is important to measure the kerf. The laser cutter burns away portion of the material when it cuts through the plywood and that portion is called kerf. To measure the kerf, we drew 10 rectangles in Fusion 360.  </p>
                            
                                <img src="images/kerf_sketch.jpg" width ="400px" height = "auto" /> 
                                <p> When the laser cutter had cut the plywood, the rectangles were pushed together and the space that formed was measured, 1.73 mm. This measurement was then divided by the number of lines that were cut, 11. The kerf is then 1.57mm.</p>
                        
            
                                <img src="images/kerf.jpg" width ="350px" height = "auto" />
                                
                                <h2 class = "major">The parametric design</h2>
                                  <h3 class = "major">Preparation</h3>
                                <p>I brainstormed for some time and then got the idea of making a tic tac toe puzzle game. Before I started drawing in Fusion 360 I made a sketch of the design and decided all the dimensions. </p>
                                <img src="images/laser_sketch.jpg" width="300px" height= "auto" />
                                <p>As a total Fusion 360 beginner, I began by watching a few Fusion 360 tutorials on YouTube (links below) to get to know the software. I used parameters for the dimensions to make it easier to scale the design. The parameters can be seen on the picture below. </p>
                                <img src="images/parametrar.jpg" width="570px" height= "auto" />
                                <h3 class="major">Drawing in Fusion 360</h3>
                                <p>I then started drawing the frame for the puzzle, the frame had finger press-fit.</p>
                                <img src="images/Geirnegling.jpg" width="570px" height= "auto" />
                                <p>I had to make eight center panels so the X and O puzzles could fit properly side by side. I used press fit to secure the center panels in the frame. </p>
                                <div class="row">
                                    <div class="column">
                                        <img src="images/pressfit_skolud.jpg" width="350px" height= "auto">
                                    </div>
                                    <div class="column">
                                        <img src="images/midjuspjold.jpg" width="350px" height= "auto">
                                    </div>
                                    <div class="column">
                                        <img src="images/midja_fest_i_skolud.jpg" width="350px" height= "auto">
                                    </div>
                                </div>
                                
                                When the frame and the center panels were ready, I started making the puzzles. I had a hard time figuring out the best way to make the puzzles, so I tried drawing one big panel on top of the frame and used the combine-cut tool in Fusion 360 and it worked fine. I then cut each puzzle out from the panel, making sure it would be easy to move them around.
                            
                                <div class="row">
                                    <div class="column">

                                    </div>
                                    <div class="column">
                                        <img src="images/plata_eitt_pusl_1.jpg" width="350px" height= "auto">
                                    </div>
                                    <div class="column">

                                </div>
                                The next step was to cut the Os and Xs out from the puzzles. It was challenging to draw the Xs so they'd look decent. I used the mirror tool in Fusion 360 for the X to make the drawing process simpler.
                                
                                 <div class="row">

                                   <h3 class="major">Finishing touches in Fusion 360 and the laser cutter process</h3>
                                     <p>I followed the <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1Btaqhog9E">tutorial</a> made by the teachers which explained the finishing process step-by-step. I put all the pieces in the same plane by using the align-tool and the move/copy-tool. The next step was to find the laser-cutter tool in the manufacture workspace and adjust the kerf width to the one we had measured. </p>
                                    
                                        <img src="images/aligned_skalad.jpg" width="700px" height= "auto">
                                     <p>I exported the design as DXF file and imported it to Inkscape, where I could arrange the pieces on the 500mmx500mm plywood surface.
                                         The next step was to laser cut! I used the laser cutter which is located in VR3. </p>
                                      <img src="images/leiserskeri.jpg" width="350px" height= "auto">
                                     <p>The plywood was slightly warped so the laser didn't always cut completely through the material, that's why I cut some lines twice.
                                    </p>
                               
                                     <img src="images/tilbuidpusl.jpg" width ="350px" height = "auto" />
                                    <p>I think the final result looks great and I am so happy with my new puzzle.</p>
